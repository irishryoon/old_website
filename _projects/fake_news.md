During my 5 week fellowship at <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/ds4a">Data Science for All Women's Summit</a> (Fall 2020), my teammates and I built a fake news detector using various natural language processing tools such as embeddings, RNN, BERT, and transfer learning. We performed careful preprocessing to remove biases in the dataset, and we used a model interpretability tool called LIME to identify points of improvement for our model. 

Take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/s-chrodinger/fake-news-detection">code</a> on GitHub!
