### Data Science for Social Good

Are you looking for ways to create change in your community through data science? Check out the following.

[CodeForPhilly](https://codeforphilly.org/) 
A volunteer-based organization that uses technology, data, and UX design to engage with the City of Philadelphia. I volunteered from 2020 to 2021, and I worked closely with the [Philadelphia Bail Fund](https://www.phillybailfund.org/) to understand how the bail system affects different communities in Philadelphia. 

[QSIDE Institute](https://qsideinstitute.org/)
A research-into-action network that applies math and data science for social justice. They regularly host colloquiums, conferences, and datathons. I participated in one of their datathons, and it was an amazing opportunity to use data science to analyze real-world criminal justice datasets.  

[DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/) A global network that helps mission-driven organizations harness their data through data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. You can apply to be a volunteer. 

[Delta Analytics](http://www.deltanalytics.org/) A community that helps non-profits build technical capacity. They have 6-month-long fellowships programs for students enrolled in Masters or PhD programs. 

[Statistics Without Borders](https://www.statisticswithoutborders.org/) A volunteer outreach group of the American Statistical Association that provides pro bono services in statistics and data science.

### Mathematics & Data Science for All
[Data Science for All - Women's Summit](https://www.correlation-one.com/data-science-for-all-women) A fellowship program designed to train for women interested in data science and analytics roles. I was a fellow in this program. 

[Data Science for All - Empowerment](https://www.correlation-one.com/data-science-for-all-empowerment) A data analytics training and jobs program made available for free to qualifying students from underrepresented communities. If you identify as Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+, or any other underrepresented group, or if you are a military veteran, this is a great program.
