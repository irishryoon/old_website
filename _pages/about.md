I am a mathematician working in the field of topological data analysis. I develop novel topological data analysis tools for understanding problems in computational biology, including neuroscience, image analysis, and genomics. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a> at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. I received my PhD in <a href="https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/">Applied Mathematics and Computational Science</a> from the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/"> Robert Ghrist</a>.
