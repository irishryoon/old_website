I am a mathematician and a data scientist working in the field of topological data analysis and computational biology. I recently completed my postdoctoral appointment at the <a href="https://www.udel.edu/">University of Delaware</a> department of <a href="https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/">Mathematical Sciences</a>. During my postdoc, I developed novel topological data analysis tools for understanding neural population coding and propagation. I received my PhD in <a href="https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/">Applied Mathematics and Computational Science</a> from the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/"> Robert Ghrist</a>.
