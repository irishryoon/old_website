I am a mathematician and a data scientist working in the field of computational neuroscience, computational genomics, and topological data analysis. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a> department of <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu"> Electrical and Systems Engineering</a>. I received my PhD in <a href="https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/">Applied Mathematics and Computational Science</a> from the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/"> Robert Ghrist</a>.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
